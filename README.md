Scrum Tool Application for the Software Engineering course :

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We've built a web based scrum tool where the product managers take a strategic approach to building products and planing, assigning tasks to developers and QAs, estimate each task and keep track of it by the Dev/QA and the manager. 
I was responsible for the software architecture, design and code on the backend side.
